This  is  because  any  purchase  of  tickets  of  a foreign (Non-Pakistani) airline is treated as a foreign currency transaction. Therefore, in accordance with the Cardmember Terms and Conditions, the transaction will be subject to all our applicable rules and procedures  for  foreign  currency  conversion  into  Pakistani  Rupees, based on the exchange rate being used by us at the time of conversion.",
